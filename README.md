# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Real-time Credit Card Financial Dashboard using ProgreSQL and Microsoft Power BI.

The query editing was done in 'ProgreSQL,' and the visualization part used 'Microsoft Power BI.' Also, for analysis, I used Power BI's query tool.


**Setup**
- This project requires an SQL Server (ProgreSQL) and Power BI Desktop.
- The datasets used for analysis are
  1. credit_card.csv
  2. customer.csv
  3. cc_add.csv
  4. cust_add.csv


**Clean the data using ProgreSQL**
- Understand the difference between the tables.
- Choose which columns are of interest to export by preparing and transforming these columns in SQL using concepts such as: renaming columns, combining columns, commenting in SQL script, formatting of SQL statements, WHERE clause, ORDER BY, LEFT JOIN, CASE() function and ISNULL() function.
